# Vending Machine Simulator

For a project, my team and I built a virtual vending machine with capabilities such as:
 - Only taking valid U.S currency
 - Dispensing exact and correct change
 - Logging sales
 - Restock items
 - Accurately display item count, and doesn't allow sales if there are none left in stock
